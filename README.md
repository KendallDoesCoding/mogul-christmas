I was feeling bored so I made this basic HTML Project and I felt like keeping going with this fun project and got a few contributors to help me out.

# Important

**Ensure that the last Youtube video you watched wasn't on mute, otherwise the songs will not play, and the autoplay for the lyrics directory will automatically set on mute too.**

**As of now, there's no way to control the volume of the songs, I know it should be added soon, but you can reduce the volume on your device, if that's still loud though, please download the [extension (Volume Booster](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/volume-master/jghecgabfgfdldnmbfkhmffcabddioke)(even though it's meant to boost volume, it also can be used as a reducer)(available on Brave, Edge, Chrome, idk about Firefox, etc)) and reduce the volume there.. We are working on a in-built volume slider on the project site, if you would like to help, please drop a messege [here](https://github.com/KendallDoesCoding/mogul-christmas/issues/105). Thanks**
**If your using a VPN the performance may be slow/song may not play.**

If you would like dark mode on this site, you can toggle dark mode on or off by using the button in the top right corner of the site.

Also, I suggest you use [Adblocker Plus](https://mogulchristmas.kendalldoescoding.gq/adblockerplus) or any other adblocker and block ads on specifically Youtube and the project website if the sites are whitelisted in the adblocker because there's a chance that sometimes when you click a song an ad may play before. After all, this project runs via the youtube embed. Although, I may change it to run through Youtube Music or another music software soon where the ads are fewer or none for that matter. There is one adblocker that allows you to whitelist ads on a certain YouTuber, if you use that adblocker and whitelisted "Ludwig" on it, you may get ads so please un-whitelist him while running the songs on the project website. But mostly, there aren't ads so you should be good most of the time. My adblocker tells me, that for every song I am tapping on the website, including "All Of The Above" it's blocking 2 ads each, although when I went to another login without the adblocker I didn't get any ads, so the ads will only come some times, I'm just giving a fair warning.

If your running the versions between 8.0 to 10.5.0 especially please note that since version 8.0, we've updated how the website looks so that there is no embed/iframe, but that does slow down the performance how fast the song plays/the user doesn't know if the song is loading or no, but just wait 1-5 seconds and the song should play, in case of any issue, please create a bug report issue using the template in the issue panel in this repo. Since release, 10.5.0 I believe, the songs have started playing a little faster than it used to play, now it will only take 1-4 seconds.

# Deploy Status

Below, you can see the progress of the GitHub deployment to the site. In case a change is made to this repo, it takes around 1-5 minutes to display on the site, depending on if there are other deploy's going on within Pull Requests or within repos that have sites, because using Netlify, I can only deploy one thing at a time.
