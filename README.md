# mogul-christmas

I was feeling bored so I made this basic HTML Project and I felt like keeping going with this fun project and got a few contributors to help me out. If you would like darkmode on this site, you can toggle dark-mode on or off by using the button in the top right corner of the site.

# Important 
Ensure that the last Youtube video you watched wasn't on mute, otherwise the songs will not play, and the autoplay for the lyrics directory will automatically set on mute too.

Also, I suggest you use [Adblocker Plus](https://mogulchristmas.kendalldoescoding.gq/adblockerplus) or any other adblocker because there's a chance that sometimes when you click a song a ad may play before, because this project runs via the youtube embed. Although, I may change it to run through Youtube Music or another music software soon where the ads are less. But mostly, there aren't ads so you should be good most of the time.

# Deploy Status
Below, you can see the progress of the github deploy to the site. Incase a change is made to this repo, it takes around 1-5 minutes to display on the site, depending on if there's other deploy's going on within Pull Requests or within repos which have sites, because using Netlify, I can only deploy one thing at a time.

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/c9a61158-0ccb-489e-ba45-85eafcf4bc3b/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/mogulchristmas/deploys)
