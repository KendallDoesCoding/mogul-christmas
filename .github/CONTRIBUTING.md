We don't have many CONTRIBUTING Guidelines for now.
Feel free to contribute and if I like your new feature request, or if you fixed a bug, which was on the issue pannel, I'll be sure to merge it into the project.

1) Make sure it doesn't mess up anything on the website
2) If it fixes a feature or bug, please mention Fixes #(mention issue number) because that will save my time.

Also, please note, that if you don't want to do local testing, just make a PR, and Netlify (this site hosting service) will give you a special deploy (for PR) link.

Thanks,
Kendall Does Coding
