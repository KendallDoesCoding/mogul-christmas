  <p>Chestnuts roasting on an open fire</p>\
  <p>Jack Frost nipping at your nose</p>\
  <p>Yuletide carols being sung by a choir</p>\
  <p>And folks dressed up like Eskimos</p>\
  <p>Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe</p>\
  <p>Help to make the season bright</p>\
  <p>Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow</p>\

  <p>They know that Santa's on his way</p>\
  <p>He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh</p>\

  <p>And so I'm offering this simple phrase</p>\
  <p>To kids from one to ninety-two</p>\
  <p>Although it's been said many times, many ways</p>\
  <p>Merry Christmas to you</p>\
