Ooh
Merry Christmas Saint Nick
Christmas comes this time each year
Ooh, ooh

Well way up North where the air gets cold
There's a tale about Christmas
That you've all been told
And a real famous cat all dressed up in red
And he spends the whole year workin' out on his sled

It's the little Saint Nick (little Saint Nick)
It's the little Saint Nick (little Saint Nick)

Just a little bobsled we call the old Saint Nick
But she'll walk a toboggan with a four speed stick
She's candy apple red with a ski for a wheel
And when Santa hits the gas, man, just watch her peel

It's the little Saint Nick (little Saint Nick)
It's the little Saint Nick (little Saint Nick)

Run run reindeer
Run run reindeer (whoa)
Run run reindeer
Run run reindeer (he don't miss no one)

And haulin' through the snow at a frightening speed
With a half a dozen deer with Rudy to lead
He's got to wear his goggles 'cause the snow really flies
And he's cruisin' every path with a little surprise

It's the little Saint Nick (little Saint Nick)
It's the little Saint Nick (little Saint Nick)

Ooh
Merry Christmas Saint Nick
(Christmas comes this time each year)

Ooh
Merry Christmas Saint Nick
(Christmas comes this time each year)

Ooh
Merry Christmas Saint Nick
(Christmas comes this time each year)
