# What is the Lyrics Directory?

This directory, has all the songs with lyrics.

## Alternative to the Lyrics Directory

A alternative of this, to have lyrics on the main page, is if your using chrome, to to the following, although The only issue with this is that, it uses Youtube Captions, and that's absolutely not accurate, so I recommend you use the lyrics directory:

Tap this near your extensions: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84712013/154449488-68225ff8-9387-4a48-a2ff-dc8bd4bd6a58.png)

Tap "Live Caption (English Only)"

Wait for it to download

Play the song and you will get lyrics on the tab you are currently on.
