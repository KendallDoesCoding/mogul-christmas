// The Christmas Song

<div class="lyrics">
  <p>Chestnuts roasting on an open fire</p>
  <p>Jack Frost nipping at your nose</p>
  <p>Yuletide carols being sung by a choir</p>
  <p>And folks dressed up like Eskimos</p>
  <p>Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe</p>
  <p>Help to make the season bright</p>
  <p>Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow</p>
  <p>Will find it hard to sleep tonight</p>
  <p>They know that Santa's on his way</p>
  <p>He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh</p>
  <p>And every mother's child is gonna spy</p>
  <p>To see if reindeers really know how to fly</p>
  <p>And so I'm offering this simple phrase</p>
  <p>To kids from one to ninety-two</p>
  <p>Although it's been said many times, many ways</p>
  <p>Merry Christmas to you</p>
  <p>And so I'm offering this simple phrase</p>
  <p>To kids from one to ninety-two</p>
  <p>Although it's been said many times, many ways</p>
  <p>Merry Christmas to you</p>

// Baby It's Cold Outside

<div class="lyrics-1">
    <p>I really can't stay</p>
    <p>Baby it's cold outside</p>
    <p>I gotta go away</p>
    <p>Baby it's cold outside</p>
    <p>This evening has been</p>
    <p>Been hoping that you'd dropped in</p>
    <p>So very nice</p>
    <p>I'll hold your hands they're just like ice</p>
    <p>My mother will start to worry</p>
    <p>Beautiful what's your hurry?</p>
    <p>My father will be pacing the floor</p>
    <p>Listen to the fireplace roar</p>
    <p>So really I'd better scurry</p>
    <p>Beautiful please don't hurry</p>
    <p>Well maybe just a half a drink more</p>
    <p>I'll put some records on while I pour</p>
    <p>The neighbors might think</p>
    <p>Baby it's bad out there</p>
    <p>Say what's in this drink?</p>
    <p>No cabs to be had out there</p>
    <p>I wish I knew how</p>
    <p>Your eyes are like starlight now</p>
    <p>To break this spell</p>
    <p>I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell</p>
    <p>Why thank you</p>
    <p>I ought to say no, no, no sir</p>
    <p>Mind if move in closer?</p>
    <p>At least I'm gonna say that I tried</p>
    <p>What's the sense of hurting my pride?</p>
    <p>I really can't stay</p>
    <p>Baby don't hold out</p>
    <p>Baby it's cold outside</p>
    <p>Ah, you're very pushy you know?</p>
    <p>I like to think of it as opportunistic</p>
    <p>I simply must go</p>
    <p>Baby it's cold outside</p>
    <p>The answer is no</p>
    <p>But baby it's cold outside</p>
    <p>The welcome has been</p>
    <p>How lucky that you dropped in</p>
    <p>So nice and warm</p>
    <p>Look out the window at that storm</p>
    <p>My sister will be suspicious</p>
    <p>Gosh your lips look delicious!</p>
    <p>My brother will be there at the door</p>
    <p>Waves upon a tropical shore</p>
    <p>My maiden aunt's mind is vicious</p>
    <p>Gosh your lips are delicious!</p>
    <p>Well maybe just a cigarette more</p>
    <p>Never such a blizzard before</p>
    <p>And I don't even smoke</p>
    <p>I've got to get home</p>
    <p>Baby you'll freeze out there</p>
    <p>Say lend me your comb</p>
    <p>It's up to your knees out there!</p>
    <p>You've really been grand,</p>
    <p>I feel when I touch your hand</p>
    <p>But don't you see?</p>
    <p>How can you do this thing to me?</p>
    <p>There's bound to be talk tomorrow</p>
    <p>Think of my life long sorrow!</p>
    <p>At least there will be plenty implied</p>
    <p>If you caught pneumonia and died!</p>
    <p>I really can't stay</p>
    <p>Get over that old out</p>
    <p>Baby it's cold</p>
    <p>Baby it's cold outside</p>
    <p>Okay fine, just another drink then</p>
    <p>That took a lot of convincing!</p>
