I really can't stay
Baby it's cold outside
I gotta go away
Baby it's cold outside
This evening has been
Been hoping that you'd dropped in
So very nice
I'll hold your hands they're just like ice

My mother will start to worry
Beautiful what's your hurry?
My father will be pacing the floor
Listen to the fireplace roar
So really I'd better scurry
Beautiful please don't hurry
Well maybe just a half a drink more
I'll put some records on while I pour

The neighbors might think
Baby it's bad out there
Say what's in this drink?
No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight now
To break this spell
I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell
Why thank you
I ought to say no, no, no sir
Mind if move in closer?
At least I'm gonna say that I tried
What's the sense of hurting my pride?
I really can't stay
Baby don't hold out
Baby it's cold outside

Ah, you're very pushy you know?
I like to think of it as opportunistic

I simply must go
Baby it's cold outside
The answer is no
But baby it's cold outside
The welcome has been
How lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm
Look out the window at that storm
My sister will be suspicious
Gosh your lips look delicious!
My brother will be there at the door
Waves upon a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
Gosh your lips are delicious!
Well maybe just a cigarette more
Never such a blizzard before
And I don't even smoke

I've got to get home
Baby you'll freeze out there
Say lend me your comb

It's up to your knees out there!
You've really been grand,
I feel when I touch your hand
But don't you see?
How can you do this thing to me?

There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Think of my life long sorrow!
At least there will be plenty implied
If you caught pneumonia and died!
I really can't stay
Get over that old out
Baby it's cold
Baby it's cold outside

Okay fine, just another drink then
That took a lot of convincing!
